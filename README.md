# MusicPlayerWidget
This is simple MusicPlayerWidget.

## Notice
When I carried out the instrumented unit test for Service, I commented below code(the line) colling startForeground(true).
Please comment(block) below code whenever you run the instrumented unit test for Service in PlayerService.java :

stopForeground(true) & startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, mNotificationBuilder.build());
